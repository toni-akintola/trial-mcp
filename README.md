# TrialGPT: Matching Patients to Clinical Trials with Large Language Models

## Introduction
Clinical trials are often hindered by the challenge of patient recruitment. In this work, we introduce TrialGPT, a novel end-to-end framework for zero-shot patient-to-trial matching with large language models (LLMs). TrialGPT consists of three key components: it first performs filtering of irrelevant clinical trials at scale (TrialGPT-Retrieval), then predicts the patient eligibility on a criterion-by-criterion basis (TrialGPT-Matching); and finally aggregates criterion-level predictions into trial-level scores for ranking the clinical trials (TrialGPT-Ranking). We evaluate TrialGPT on three publicly available cohorts of 183 synthetic patients with over 75,000 trial eligibility annotations. TrialGPT-Retrieval can efficiently recall over 90% of relevant clinical trials using only less than 6% of the initial clinical trial collection. Over 1,000 patient-criterion pairs were manually annotated by three physicians to evaluate TrialGPT-Matching, which achieves a criterion-level accuracy of 87.3% with faithful explanations, close to the expert performance (88.7%â€“90.0%). For TrialGPT-Ranking, the aggregated trial-level scores are highly correlated with human eligibility judgments, and they outperform the best-competing models by 28.8% to 53.5% in ranking and excluding clinical trials. Furthermore, our user study reveals that TrialGPT can significantly reduce the screening time by 42.6% in a real-life clinical trial matching task. Taken together, these results have demonstrated promising opportunities for clinical trial matching with LLMs via the TrialGPT framework.

## Configuration

To run TrialGPT, one needs to set up the Anthropic API. Please set the environment variable accordingly:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
```

The code has been tested with Python 3.9.13 using CentOS Linux release 7.9.2009 (Core). Please install the required Python packages by:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Datasets

We used the clinical trial information on https://clinicaltrials.gov/. Please download our parsed dataset by:

```bash
wget -O dataset/trial_info.json https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/TrialGPT/trial_info.json
```

Three publicly available datasets are used in the study (please properly cite these datasets if you use them; see details about citations in the bottom):
- The SIGIR 2016 corpus, available at: https://data.csiro.au/collection/csiro:17152
- The TREC Clinical Trials 2021 corpus, available at: https://www.trec-cds.org/2021.html
- The TREC Clinical Trials 2022 corpus, available at: https://www.trec-cds.org/2022.html

The SIGIR dataset is already in `/dataset/`, please download the corpora of TREC CT 2021 and 2022 by:

```bash
wget -O dataset/trec_2021/corpus.jsonl https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/TrialGPT/trec_2021_corpus.jsonl
wget -O dataset/trec_2022/corpus.jsonl https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/TrialGPT/trec_2022_corpus.jsonl
```

## TrialGPT-Retrieval

Given a patient summary and an initial collection of clinical trials, the first step is TrialGPT-Retrieval, which generates a list of keywords for the patient and utilizes a hybrid-fusion retrieval mechanism to get relevant trials (component a in the figure). 

Specifically, one can run the code below for keyword generation. The generated keywords will be saved in the `./results/` directory.

```bash
# syntax: python trialgpt_retrieval/keyword_generation.py ${corpus} ${model}  
# ${corpus} can be sigir, trec_2021, and trec_2022
# ${model} should be an Anthropic model name (e.g., claude-3-opus-20240229, claude-3-sonnet-20240229)
# examples below (replace with actual Anthropic model names)
python trialgpt_retrieval/keyword_generation.py sigir claude-3-opus-20240229
python trialgpt_retrieval/keyword_generation.py trec_2021 claude-3-opus-20240229
python trialgpt_retrieval/keyword_generation.py trec_2022 claude-3-opus-20240229
```

After generating the keywords, one can run the code below for retrieving relevant clinical trials. The retrieved trials will be saved in the `./results/` directory. The code below will use our cached results of keyword generation that are located in `./dataset/{corpus}/id2queries.json`. (Note: cached results may still refer to OpenAI models, new keywords should be generated with Anthropic models for consistency).

```bash
# syntax: python trialgpt_retrieval/hybrid_fusion_retrieval.py ${corpus} ${q_type} ${k} ${bm25_weight} ${medcpt_weight} 
# ${corpus} can be sigir, trec_2021, and trec_2022
# ${q_type} can be raw, or an Anthropic model name used for generation (e.g., claude-3-opus-20240229). Cached OpenAI model names (gpt-35-turbo, gpt-4-turbo) might not work correctly without re-generation.
# ${k} is the constant in the reciprocal rank fusion, and we recommend using 20
# ${bm25_weight} is the weight for the BM25 retriever, it should be set as 1 unless in ablation experiments
# ${medcpt_weight} is the weight for the MedCPT retriever, it should be set as 1 unless in ablation experiments
# examples below (replace with actual Anthropic model names if not using 'raw' or re-generated keywords)
python trialgpt_retrieval/hybrid_fusion_retrieval.py sigir claude-3-opus-20240229 20 1 1
python trialgpt_retrieval/hybrid_fusion_retrieval.py trec_2021 claude-3-opus-20240229 20 1 1
python trialgpt_retrieval/hybrid_fusion_retrieval.py trec_2022 claude-3-opus-20240229 20 1 1
```

## TrialGPT-Matching

After retrieving the candidate clinical trials with TrialGPT-Retrieval, the next step is to use TrialGPT-Matching to perform fine-grained criterion-by-criterion analyses on each patient-trial pair (component b in the figure). We have also made the retrieved trials by GPT-4-based TrialGPT-Retrieval available at `./dataset/{corpus}/retrieved_trials.json`. (Note: these cached trials were based on OpenAI models).
One can run the following commands to use TrialGPT-Matching, and the results will be saved in `./results/`:

```bash
# syntax: python trialgpt_matching/run_matching.py ${corpus} ${model}
# ${corpus} can be sigir, trec_2021, and trec_2022
# ${model} should be an Anthropic model name (e.g., claude-3-opus-20240229)
# examples below
python trialgpt_matching/run_matching.py sigir claude-3-opus-20240229
python trialgpt_matching/run_matching.py trec_2021 claude-3-opus-20240229
python trialgpt_matching/run_matching.py trec_2022 claude-3-opus-20240229
```

## TrialGPT-Ranking

The final step is to use TrialGPT-Ranking to aggregate the criterion-level predictions into trial-level scores for ranking (component c in the figure). To get the LLM-aggregation scores for TrialGPT-Ranking, one can run the following commands. The results will be saved in `./results/`:

```bash
# syntax: python trialgpt_ranking/run_aggregation.py ${corpus} ${model} ${matching_results_path}
# ${corpus} can be sigir, trec_2021, and trec_2022
# ${model} should be an Anthropic model name (e.g., claude-3-opus-20240229)
# ${matching_results_path} is the path to the TrialGPT matching results 
# example below (ensure matching results were generated using an Anthropic model)
python trialgpt_ranking/run_aggregation.py sigir claude-3-opus-20240229 results/matching_results_sigir_claude-3-opus-20240229.json
```

Once the matching results and the aggregation results are complete, one can run the following code to get the final ranking of clinical trials for each patient:

```bash
# syntax: python trialgpt_ranking/rank_results.py ${matching_results_path} ${aggregation_results_path}
# ${matching_results_path} is the path to the TrialGPT matching results 
# ${aggregation_results_path} is the path to the aggregation results generated above
# example below (ensure results were generated using an Anthropic model)
python trialgpt_ranking/rank_results.py results/matching_results_sigir_claude-3-opus-20240229.json results/aggregation_results_sigir_claude-3-opus-20240229.json
```

Example output:

```bash
Patient ID: sigir-20141
Clinical trial ranking:
NCT00185120 2.8999999995
NCT02144636 2.8999999995
NCT02608255 2.84999999975
NCT01724996 2.7999999998
...
```
